# go-corelibs/path - utilities and convenience wrappers for all sorts of unix and URL path operations

The heading says it all. This package is likely a great candidate for
a general refactoring into more targeted Go packages, however, it has
proven quite convenient for Go-Enjin to have all these sorts of things
in one place.

# Installation

``` shell
> go get github.com/go-corelibs/path@latest
```

# Examples

There are too many things to demonstrate, see the [godoc] for the full details.

# Go-CoreLibs

[Go-CoreLibs] is a repository of shared code between the [Go-Curses] and
